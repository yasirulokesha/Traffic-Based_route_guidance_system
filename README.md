# Traffic-Based Route Guidance System (TBRGS)

**COS30019 – Intelligent Systems Assignment 2B**  
Team ID: Group 3

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements a **Traffic-Based Route Guidance System (TBRGS)** that uses machine learning models to forecast traffic volumes and estimate optimal travel paths through the City of Boroondara. By combining predictive modeling with graph search algorithms, the system dynamically guides users through the most efficient routes based on expected traffic conditions.

This system builds upon the foundational work from Assignment 2A and extends it with:
- Multiple time-series machine learning models (LSTM, GRU, and a third model)
- Dynamic prediction of future traffic volume
- Travel time estimation based on predicted traffic
- A top-k shortest path route finder
- A user-friendly graphical interface for real-time interaction

## 📊 Machine Learning Models

We implemented and compared the following time-series models:

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** RNN variant effective for sequence prediction.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** Lightweight alternative to LSTM with fewer parameters.
- **[Third Model, e.g., Random Forest Regressor or Transformer]:** Chosen for baseline or hybrid performance.

Each model was trained on traffic volume data recorded from sensors across Boroondara in October 2006, predicting volume at 15-minute intervals for future times.

## 🧮 How It Works

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load and clean time-series traffic sensor data
   - Normalize and reshape for training ML models

### 2. **Traffic Forecasting**
   - Train LSTM, GRU, and another model on historical data
   - Predict traffic volume for user-selected future times

### 3. **Travel Time Estimation**
   - Translate predicted volume into travel time using a regression-based mapping formula

### 4. **Route Finding**
   - Construct a graph where nodes = intersections and edges = road segments
   - Use Dijkstra’s algorithm or A* to calculate **top-k shortest paths** by predicted travel time

### 5. **Graphical User Interface**
   - Users select source, destination, and future time
   - GUI displays top-k recommended paths with estimated travel times and visual overlays

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone 
cd TBRGS
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed, then:
Make an Anconda environment and install with followings
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Launch the App
```bash
python run.py
```

This will open the GUI for route prediction and display.
